🔐 Secure Anonymous Evidence Vault

A secure, integrity-preserving digital evidence storage system designed for anonymous submissions and forensic verification.

📌 Overview

The Secure Anonymous Evidence Vault is a cybersecurity-focused project(MVP) that enables users to securely upload digital evidence, store it in encrypted form, and later verify its integrity using cryptographic hashing.

The system is designed with forensic soundness, confidentiality, and tamper detection in mind — aligning with real-world digital forensics and incident response workflows.

🎯 Problem Statement

Digital evidence is often:

Altered intentionally or unintentionally, Stored without proper integrity verification & Difficult to validate during investigations

This project addresses these challenges by implementing:
Encryption at rest, Hash-based integrity verification & Case-ID–based evidence tracking

🛡️ Key Security Features

🔑 Encryption at Rest
Evidence files are encrypted before storage to prevent unauthorized access.

🧾 Cryptographic Hashing (SHA-256)
Each file is hashed at upload time to establish a forensic integrity baseline.

🧬 Tamper Detection
Any modification to stored evidence is detected during verification.

🆔 Unique Case ID Generation
Each submission is assigned a UUID for traceability without revealing identity.

🗃️ Forensic Metadata Logging
Hash values and storage paths are recorded securely in a database.

🧪 Evidence Verification Flow

Investigator provides a Case ID -> Encrypted evidence is retrieved -> Hash is recalculated -> Hash is compared with the original stored hash

System reports:

✅ Integrity Verified

⚠️ Evidence Tampered
